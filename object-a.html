        <p> This photo was taken On merit island around a year and a half ago during a photography project in which the goal was to take varying types of photographs. The reason why this photograph holds some significance to me is it, in addition to being a capsule of the times, it also holds a good moment with my family and cousins. The day that this was taken we had also traveled around the island for a significant hike for the better part of the day, ocassionally stoping to relax and take photoâ€™s but the time spent together before coming to this point is what makes photo so significant. <p>
